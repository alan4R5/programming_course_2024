        <li>Soundtrack and Sound Effects: Music and sound effects help create the atmosphere of the game and can increase immersion. A catchy soundtrack can make the game memorable.</li> 
    </ul>
    <h3>And here are market diferentials:</h3>

        <li>Creativity and Innovation: Games that introduce new ideas or a unique approach to the genre can stand out and provide a refreshing experience.</li>
        <li>Replayability: Elements such as multiple paths, hidden secrets and achievements can encourage the player to play again, increasing the game's longevity.</li>

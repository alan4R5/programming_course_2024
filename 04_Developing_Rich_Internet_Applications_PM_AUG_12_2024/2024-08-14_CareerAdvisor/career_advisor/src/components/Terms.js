                    want you to wonder about any of our processes or procedures or guess as to what your interaction

                    urge you to read these terms or any section of interest to you. You are agreeing to proceed
                    under them.

                    Any references to “CA” or “we” in this Agreement shall mean the applicable entity as set
                    forth above.

                    *For the purposes of this Agreement, the Asia-Pacific Region is defined as the following
                    countries and territories: American Samoa, Antarctica, Australia, Bangladesh, Bhutan, Brunei,
                    Cambodia, China, Christmas Island, Cocos Islands, Cook Islands, East Timor, Fiji, French

                    The Site is made available for use only by individuals searching for employment openings, or
                    services or information related to their personal employment or job search (“Job Seekers”), by
                    individuals and/or organizations seeking information related to hiring or human resources,
                    seeking Job Seekers, or seeking to make available information regarding employment openings, on
                    their behalf or other’s behalf, including but not limited to agencies purchasing for multiple
                    parties and employment agencies (“Employers”), and by individuals and/or organizations seeking
                    to participate in the CA Publisher Program (“Publishers”). You acknowledge and agree that
                    your license to use the Site is automatically revoked upon your attempt to use the Site for any
                    other purpose.<br />

                    Except as otherwise provided below, CA does not act as an employment agency, or any other
                    type of agent, by providing the Site or its tools. CA provides the Site solely as an
                    independent contractor and does not have authority to act or make employment decisions on behalf
                    of Employers or Job Seekers. Nothing in this Agreement or on the Site should be construed as
                    creating an agency relationship between us and Employers.<br />

                    In the United States and United Kingdom, our affiliate CA Flex, Inc. may provide services as
                    a staffing agency to its clients. Further, CA Hire, Inc. and CA Ireland Operations
                    Limited may provide services as an employment agency to its clients pursuant to a written
                    agreement with clients separate from this Agreement (together “CA Hire”). These services are
                    separate from the Site and may involve such affiliates using the Site on their clients’ behalf.
                    In Japan, CA Japan K.K. may offer services as an employment placement business provider (as
                    defined under applicable law) in accordance with this Agreement and the rules set forth in its
                    website (any such services are marked as offered by “CA Agent”).<br />

                    If you are accessing or using the Site in your capacity as an employee or other representative
                    of an Employer or Publisher, you are agreeing to this Agreement on behalf of yourself and such
                    Employer or Publisher, as applicable, and you represent and warrant that you have the authority
                    to bind such Employer or Publisher, as applicable, to this Agreement. If you are using assistive
                    technology to access the Site and you need help, you can call CA at 1-800-462-5842 (United
                    States) or 1-866-439-8615 (Canada), or you can email accessibility @ CA.com. You acknowledge

                    of information available through any of the foregoing.<br />

                    CA may disable any account or restrict your ability to use all or parts of the Site, for any
                    or no reason without notice. Although CA may indicate why User Content or an account has
                    been removed or disabled, we cannot give every reason why User Content or an account may be
                    removed. We always retain the right to remove any User Content or account if we feel it is in
                    our interest or our Users’ interest.<br />

                    We may change this Agreement by notifying you of such changes by any reasonable means, including
                    by posting a revised Agreement through the Site. Any such changes will not apply to any claim
                    brought prior to the date on which we posted the revised Agreement incorporating such changes,
                    or otherwise notified you of such changes. Your access to or use of the Site following any
                    changes to this Agreement will constitute your acceptance of such changes. The “Last Updated”
                    legends in each section of the terms and conditions indicate when this Agreement was last
                    changed. We may, at any time and without liability, modify or discontinue all or part of the
                    Site (including access to the Site via any third-party links); charge, modify or waive any fees
                    required to use the Site; or offer opportunities to some or all Site users.<br />
